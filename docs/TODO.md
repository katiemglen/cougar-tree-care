# Cougar Tree Care — Website TODO

## 🌳 Educational Resources Section (from David/James)
**Priority: Get from David his arborist training materials**

### Goal
Add a Resources/Education section to the website where customers can learn tree care at a doctorate level — the HOW and WHY, not just surface-level tips.

### Topics to Cover (from James's ISA training)
- **Tree Disease Identification** — Dutch elm disease, oak wilt, emerald ash borer, fire blight, etc. Symptoms, causes, treatment options, when to remove vs save
- **Proper Planting Depth** — why too deep kills trees, root flare visibility, common mistakes
- **Soil Acidity & pH** — what different species need, how to test, how to amend
- **Moisture Requirements** — overwatering vs underwatering, seasonal needs, drainage
- **Root Growth Patterns by Species** — tap root vs fibrous vs surface roots, why it matters for planting location
- **Best Replacement Trees for Fargo-Moorhead** — Zone 4 hardy species, diversity recommendations post-ash die-off
- **Pruning Science** — why timing matters (dormant vs active), wound response, compartmentalization (CODIT model)
- **Structural Assessment** — how arborists evaluate risk, lean, co-dominant stems, included bark

### Format Ideas
- Blog-style articles or accordion sections
- Seasonal care guides (spring/summer/fall/winter)
- Species spotlight pages
- "Ask the Arborist" FAQ expansion
- Downloadable care sheets (PDF)

### Action Items
- [ ] Katie: Ask David for his arborist training materials/notes
- [ ] Katie: Ask what topics his customers ask about most
- [ ] Atlas: Build resource section template once content is available
- [ ] Consider: Video content of James explaining concepts on-site
